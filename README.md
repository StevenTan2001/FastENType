# FastENType
It is a simpler and faster English inputting method based on rime.


# How to type? Here are some instructions:
1. Type in the order according to the letters in the word. 
2. Always type the first letter of the word. 
3. Always ignore vowel letters (_a/e/i/o/u_) unless it is the first/last letter in the word.
4. _y_ and _w_ are considered as vowel letters if **i) they are at the end of the word** OR **ii) they are NOT closely followed by a vowel**. 
5. _n_ and _r_ should be omitted unless they are closely followed by a vowel. 
6. Always type the last letter of the word.
7. Press space or number keys to choose the word you want to input.
8. For words equals to or shorter than 5 letters, you can also directly type the word and select by the space key. Even if it is longer than 5 letters, you can also type it directly by pressing the enter key.
9. To input a Word with the capitalized first letter, press _z_ after typing the word. To input a WORD with all letters capitalized, press _z_ twice after typing the word.
10. If punctuation occurs in a word (e.g, “-“), type words before and after the punctuation separately.
11. Alternative method with a plural word: if a word exist and does not end with an _s_, then type _s_ after a word can give a word followed by _s_. E.g., to input word "conditions", you can type _cdts_ or _cdtns_.
